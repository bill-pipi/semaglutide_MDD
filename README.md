**Figure 1a.**  Comparison of the risk of recurrent MDD diagnosis between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications cohorts, stratified by gender, age group, race and the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Outcomes were followed for 12 months after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/1/2021-2/15/2023). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 1b.**  Comparison of MDD-related medication prescriptions (anti-depressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics) between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications cohorts, stratified by gender, age group, race and the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Outcomes were followed for 12 months after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/1/2021-2/15/2023). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 1c.**  Comparison of receipt of psychotherapy in patients with obesity and MDD between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications cohorts, stratified by gender, age group, race and the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Outcomes were followed for 12 months after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/1/2021-2/15/2023). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 2a.** Comparison of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications cohorts, stratified by gender, age group, race, and the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Outcomes were followed for 12 months after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/1/2021-2/15/2023). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.

**Figure 2b.** Comparison of anxiety in patients with obesity and MDD between propensity-score matched semaglutide and non-GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications cohorts. Outcomes were followed for 12 months after the index event (first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP-1 RA anti-obesity medications during 6/1/2021-2/15/2023). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 12-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window.
